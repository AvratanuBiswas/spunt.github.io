Hi there!

<!--
<p class="message" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem">
  <strong>Welcome.</strong> I use experimental psychology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate social cognition and emotional experience in humans like you and <a href="http://www.spsp.org/blog/this-is-my-brain-on-social-cognition/" target="_blank">me</a>, and lately have become especially interested in learning more about how and why people differ. I have a Ph.D. in Social Psychology from UCLA and there worked in the labs of <a href="http://www.scn.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Matt Lieberman</a> and <a href="http://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Naomi Eisenberger</a>. I am currently finishing up a postdoctoral scientist fellowship in <a href="http://www.emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Ralph Adolphs’ Lab</a> at Caltech. To learn more, two reasonable places to start are my <a href="/public/RESUME_BobSpunt.pdf" target="_blank"> Resume</a> and <a href="/public/CV_BobSpunt.pdf" target="_blank"> CV</a>.
