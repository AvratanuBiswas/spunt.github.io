<p align="justify">I&#39;m a Social Cognitive Neuroscientist currently working as a postdoc in Ralph Adolphs&#39; <a href="http://www.emotion.caltech.edu/">Emotion and Social Cognition Laboratory</a> at Caltech. Before joining Ralph&#39;s lab, I earned my Ph.D. at UCLA while working in Matt Lieberman&#39;s <a href="http://www.scn.ucla.edu/">Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a> and Naomi Eisenberger&#39;s <a href="http://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/">Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a>.</p><p align="justify">I&#39;m trained in the methods and theories of both Social Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. My Ph.D. training at UCLA was in Social Psychology. I follow Dan Wegner and Dan Gilbert (see <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/dwegner/publications/social-psychology%E2%80%93-science-human-experience">here</a>) in asserting that Social Psychology isn&#39;t <em>just</em> the science of sociality as the name would suggest; rather, Social Psychology is the science of the human experience â€“ of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that makeup the everyday lives of ordinary people. As it turns out, our everyday experience is densely populated with other people, and this is true whether we like it or not. Thus, it makes sense that a science of everyday experience would emerge from a science focused on sociality. My Ph.D. training also featured a strong grounding in Cognitive Neuroscience, that is, the discipline of Psychology that seeks to understand how mental processes are instantiated by brain processes. My identity as a Cognitive Neuroscientist is largely tied to my heavy reliance on one of it&#39;s core methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p><p align="justify">In case you&#39;re wondering, the brain you see at the top of the page is my own. If that fact makes you wonder even more, then maybe you&#39;ll find <a href="http://www.spspblog.org/this-is-my-brain-on-social-cognition/">this</a> amusing and/or educational.</p>
