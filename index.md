I have a PhD in Social Psychology from UCLA, where I worked with Drs Matt Lieberman [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu/) and Naomi Eisenberger [Social Affective Neuroscience Lab](http://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/). I got to do a lot of exciting research while at UCLA, some of which you can read about in Matt's excellent trade book, [Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Why-Brains-Wired-Connect/dp/0307889106/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503520792&sr=8-1&keywords=social+why+brains).

After UCLA, I spent 5 years as a postdoctoral fellow in Ralph Adolph's [Emotion & Social Cognition Lab](http://www.emotion.caltech.edu/) where I've had the opportunity to apply my research to understand why some people - such as those with autism - find social situations confusing and difficult to navigate.
