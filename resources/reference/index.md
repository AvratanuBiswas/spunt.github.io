This is just me trying to collect documentation, guides, and cheat sheets for some of applications/languages I use. Some link to external sites; some feature content lifted and/or adapted from external sites. So, let's just say that I take credit for none of it.

- [Keynote](/resources/reference/keynote)
- [Matlab](/resources/reference/matlab)
