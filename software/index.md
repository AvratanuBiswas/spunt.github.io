I like to code. I also like to share my code, which you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/spunt?tab=repositories). Finally, I also like to make the code I share as useful as possible to as many people as possible. If you're an experimental psychologist or cognitive neuroscientist, the following software may be particularly useful to you:

- [bspmview](http://spunt.github.io/bspmview)
- [Why/How Localizer Task](http://spunt.github.io/whyhowlocalizer)
- [fMRI Design Optimization Software](http://spunt.github.io/easy-optimize-x)
- [Psychtoolbox Utilities](http://spunt.github.io/ptb-utilities)

If you're a MATLAB user, you might find some of [my contributions to the MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3893829-bob-spunt) generally useful.
