I have a PhD in Social Psychology from UCLA, where I worked with Drs Matt Lieberman [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://www.scn.ucla.edu/) and Naomi Eisenberger [Social Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/). I got to do a lot of exciting research while at UCLA, some of which you can read about in Matt's excellent trade book, [Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Why-Brains-Wired-Connect/dp/0307889106/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503520792&sr=8-1&keywords=social+why+brains).

After UCLA, I spent 5 years as a postdoctoral fellow in Ralph Adolph's [Emotion & Social Cognition Lab](https://www.emotion.caltech.edu/) where I had the opportunity to apply my research to understand why some people - such as those with autism - find social situations confusing and difficult to navigate.

After Caltech - and, mind you, after 7 unsuccessful years on the academic (faculty) job market - I moved to Seattle with my most incredible partner (and brilliant scientist) [Mari Preciado](http://www.marianapreciado.com/) and started exploring the world of human behavioral research work outside of academia. If you're curious where those explorations have taken me, check out my [resume](professional/RESUME_BobSpunt.pdf) and/or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobspunt/).
