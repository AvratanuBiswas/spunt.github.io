    <p align="justify">My research is broadly concerned with our <em>social expertise</em>, that is, the mental abilities that allow us to flexibly understand and engage with social situations. I study an important part of our social expertise, namely, our ability to understand and explain human behaviors. This ability is most evident in our tendency to ask and answer <em>why</em>-questions about other people's behavior. Remarkably, it develops very early in life, and if you have interacted much with toddlers, you probably already appreciate that most 3-year-old children already have the ability to produce culturally-acceptable explanations of other people's behaviors. Even more remarkable is the fact that this ability seems to develop naturally - with no formal schooling at all.</p>
    <p align="justify">My scientific approach to this topic is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on the ideas and tools offered by experimental psychology and neuroscience. In particular, I draw on methods from Social Psychology to carefully design tests that measure aspects of a person's social expertise, and use functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI) to measure that person's brain activity during test performance. <a href="http://www.spspblog.org/this-is-my-brain-on-social-cognition" target="_blank">Sometimes, I examine my own.</a></p>
