<p>
  <strong>Welcome.</strong> I have a Ph.D. in Social Psychology from UCLA and there worked in the labs of <a href="http://www.scn.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Matt Lieberman</a> and <a href="http://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Naomi Eisenberger</a>. I recently finished a postdoctoral fellowship in <a href="http://www.emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Ralph Adolphs’ Lab</a> at Caltech and am currently looking for opportunities to continue doing science in the Seattle area. To learn more about me, two reasonable places to start are my <a href="/professional/RESUME_BobSpunt.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="/professional/CV_BobSpunt.pdf" target="_blank"> CV</a>.
