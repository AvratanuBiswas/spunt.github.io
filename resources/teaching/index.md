I created these materials for an instructional lab I helped lead as part of the [2014 Training Course in fMRI](http://sitemaker.umich.edu/fmri.training.course/home) offered by the University of Michigan. They aim to provide students with practical experience in planning and designing an task-based fMRI study, preprocessing the acquired data, and analyzing and visualizing the results. The walk-through is hands-on, and tailored to analysis in MATLAB software, in particular SPM8. Moreover, much of the walk-through refers to sample data that I can't currently share publicly; however, the majority of it should be general enough to be applicable to practically any fMRI dataset you can get your hands on. For instance, there are multiple [sample fMRI datasets](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/) available on the SPM website. Anyways, maybe these instructional materials will be useful to you or someone you love. Who knows? Someday, they may even save your life...
