     <p align="justify">I am a Social Cognitive Neuroscientist working as a postdoc in Ralph Adolphs’ <a href="http://www.emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Emotion and Social Cognition Lab</a> at Caltech. Before joining Ralphs’ lab, I earned my Ph.D. in Social Psychology at UCLA while working in Matt Lieberman’s <a href="http://www.scn.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a> and Naomi Eisenberger’s <a href="http://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a>.<br><br>I follow <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/dwegner/publications/social-psychology%E2%80%93-science-human-experience" target="_blank">Dan Wegner and Dan Gilbert</a> in asserting that Social Psychology isn’t <em>just</em> the science of social behavior as the name would suggest; rather, Social Psychology is the science of the human experience – of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that makeup the everyday lives of ordinary people. As it turns out, our everyday experience is densely populated with other people, it makes sense that a science of everyday experience would emerge from a science focused on sociality. My Ph.D. training also featured a strong grounding in Cognitive Neuroscience, that is, the discipline of Psychology that seeks to understand how mental processes are instantiated by brain processes. My identity as a Cognitive Neuroscientist is largely tied to my heavy reliance on one of it’s core methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I use fMRI to examine brain activity. Usually, I examine other people’s brain activity. <a href="http://www.spspblog.org/this-is-my-brain-on-social-cognition" target="_blank">Sometimes, I examine my own.</a></p>
