This is just me trying to collect documentation, guides, and shortcuts for some of applications/languages I use. *Maybe* you'll find it useful? I should not that some of the content is culled from other sources, and when I starting making these I did a poor job of keeping track of sources. So, let's just say that I take credit for none of it.
